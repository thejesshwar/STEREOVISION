Luna is a robot with wheels and two cameras, but
she does not know how to use them to navigate. This project
focuses on developing a depth estimation method using stereo
vision so that Luna can detect obstacles. The approach involves
calculating disparity between the left and right images and
generating a heatmap where nearby objects appear red and
distant ones appear blue. The implementation is done from
scratch using OpenCV.
